# Small Development Grant Proposals

This repository is the new interface to submit your proposals for the NumFOCUS Small Development Grants (SDG) program.

## How does the SDG program work?

At the end of 2024 the SDG prorgram was reviewed and a set of recommendations were put forward that is being implemented from 2025 onwards.
A few things have changed, so read on to know what you'll need to do to take part in the coming rounds.

> [!note]
> The program is still only available for [Sponsored](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects) and [Affiliated](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects) NumFOCUS projects.
> Proposals for projects that are not on these lists won't be considered.

### Where the proposal are submitted?

Proposals are now submitted [as issues to this repository](https://github.com/numfocus/small-development-grant-proposals/issues/new/choose). This means that proposals from now on are fully open and visible to the whole community. 
By using issues on this open repository, people from the community can add comments, questions and even suggest collaborations, as well as providing updates of the evolution of the project once funded. Therefore, making it easier to enable cross-collaborations between NumFOCUS projects.

### How the projects will be selected for funding?

The proposal has been simplified, as well as the selection process. The Small Development Grants program committee will review the approprietness of the proposal (is it aligned with the project's goals? does the funding requested seems reasonable?). Between all the appropriate proposals, a randomisation algorithm will be used to rank the proposals, and they will be awarded till the funds for each round are exhausted. Since each project is limited to $10k of funding per year through this program, the randomisation algorithm will take in consideration what projects have been funded on previous rounds and the total amount of money funded so far.

The committee will select one proposal per round based on their merits that will be awarded the funds skipping the randomisation algorithm.

#### Can I see the randomisation script?

Yes! we are testing the interface and will put the script in this repository. The execution of the script will happen using github actions.

### Can I resubmit the same proposal if it hasn't been awarded?

After every selection process, all the issues with submissions that didn't get awarded will be closed.  You will be able to open a new issue and copy&paste the content from the previous round.

### I have other questions...

Email any other questions you may have to Arliss at NumFOCUS.
